Steps before running the scripts:
1. Add "C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox" (or the vbox installation location) to path
2. Set environment variable "VBOX_USER_HOME" to point to a directory where you want vbox to store its config files
3. Install putty

If connection fails when using connect.ps1, try connecting via "ssh" for the first time and then run the connect.ps1 script from the next time.
